USAGE EXAMPLES:
    # Basic transcription
    config = SpeechConfig()
    recognizer = SpeechRecognizer(config)
    result = recognizer.recognize_once_async()

    # Translation to English
    config.enable_translation = True
    recognizer = SpeechRecognizer(config)
    result = recognizer.translate_audio_data(audio_data)

    # Continuous recognition
    recognizer.start_continuous_recognition()
    # ... handle events ...
    recognizer.stop_continuous_recognition()
