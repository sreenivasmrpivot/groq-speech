### ðŸ”§ Configuration
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and management of Groq API keys
- **Mock Mode**: Demo mode for testing without real API calls
- **Environment Variables**: Configurable API endpoints and settings

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder API
- **Backend Integration**: Groq Speech API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Groq API key (optional for mock mode)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd groq-speech-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Configuration

#### Using Real Groq API

1. Get your API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Click the "Settings" button in the app
3. Enter your API key and save
4. Disable "Use Mock API" option

#### Using Mock API (Demo Mode)

1. Enable "Use Mock API" in the settings
2. No API key required
3. Simulates real API responses for demonstration

## Usage

### Single Shot Recognition

1. Select "Single Shot" mode
2. Choose operation type (Transcription or Translation)
3. Select your language
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. Speak into your microphone
6. Click "Stop Recording" when done
7. View results and performance metrics

### Continuous Recognition

1. Select "Continuous" mode
2. Choose operation type and language
3. Click "Start Recording"
4. Speak continuously - results will appear in real-time
5. Click "Stop Recording" to end

### Performance Metrics

1. Click "Show Metrics" to view detailed performance data
2. View timing breakdown charts
3. Monitor success rates and response times
4. Export data for analysis

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Groq Speech API through:

- **REST API**: For single-shot recognition
- **WebSocket**: For continuous streaming recognition
- **Audio Processing**: Converts audio to WAV format for API compatibility

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/recognize` - Single-shot transcription
- `POST /api/v1/translate` - Single-shot translation
- `WS /ws/recognize` - WebSocket for continuous recognition

## Performance Features

### Timing Metrics
- **Microphone Capture**: Time to capture audio from microphone
- **API Call**: Time for Groq API to process and respond
- **Response Processing**: Time to parse and display results
- **Total Time**: End-to-end processing time

### Visualizations
- **Pie Charts**: Timing breakdown percentages
- **Bar Charts**: Success/failure distribution
- **Line Charts**: Performance trends over time
- **Real-time Updates**: Live metric updates during recognition

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Access Issues

1. Ensure your browser has microphone permissions
2. Check that your microphone is working in other applications
3. Try refreshing the page and granting permissions again

### API Connection Issues

1. Verify your Groq API key is correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure the API endpoint is accessible
4. Try using mock mode for testing

### Performance Issues

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure you have sufficient system resources
3. Try closing other applications using microphone
4. Check network latency to Groq API
